Algorithm

Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).

Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list

In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.[1] A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Neumann as early as 1948.[2]
